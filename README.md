### [WIP ðŸš§] Writing Daemons
This is a web prototype riffing on [Maggie Appleton's explorations](https://maggieappleton.com/lm-sketchbook) on [daemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimon). Each daemon has a distinct personality and role. When activitated, they can swoop into the writing and provide edits, compliments, alternative viewpoints, and more.

This is a working version built with Langchain and OpenAI. There are currently 3 personalities set up (Editor, Researcher, and Devil's Advocate)...more to come!
